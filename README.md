The Big Integer Library is a repository containing C code for performing arithmetic operations on large integers, beyond the range of standard integer types. The library provides functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on big integers. The implementation utilizes a linked list data structure to handle arbitrarily large numbers efficiently. The `BigInteger.c` and `BigInteger.h` files contain the source code for the library, offering a comprehensive solution for dealing with big integer arithmetic in C programming. Whether you're working on cryptographic algorithms, mathematical computations, or any application requiring precise handling of large numbers, this library provides a robust and efficient solution. Feel free to explore the code, contribute enhancements, or use it in your projects.
